                        <h5><p>The story primarily revolves around street racing that occurs on Tokyo's Shuto Expressway, Bayshore Route. Wangan is the endonym of the longest, straightest road in Japan. There is also road traffic to contend with, including a fair number of heavy trucks and buses. Because of this, the action is inherently hazardous, 
                            and wrecks are common. Blown engines are also a frequent hazard, especially for cars with extremely high-powered engines. One day, Akio Asakura, was passed by a black Porsche 911 Turbo, dubbed the "Blackbird". With his friend in the passenger seat and two girls in the back, Akio attempts to win, but, is defeated.
                            Determined to drive a faster car, Akio heads for the junkyard and finds an old blue Fairlady Z...

                        <h5><p>Takumi Fujiwara, is a student working as a gas station attendant with his best friend Itsuki. Itsuki is enthusiastically interested in being a street racer. The team he feels closest to and hopes to join is the Akina Speed Stars, whose team leader Koichiro Iketani is also working at the same pump station. Unbeknownst to his colleagues, Takumi helps out his father Bunta as a tofu delivery driver for his father's store before sunrise each morning, passively building an impressive amount of skill of over 5 years behind the wheel of the family car, an aging Toyota Sprinter Trueno (AE86).
                            Shortly after the story begins, the Red Suns, a highly experienced racing team from Mount Akagi led by Ryosuke Takahashi, challenge the local Speed Stars team to a set of races on Mount Akina. Dispirited after watching the Red Suns' superior performance during a practice run, the Speed Stars expect to lose. Later that night, the Red Suns' #2 driver, Keisuke Takahashi, heading home after the last practice run, is defeated soundly by a mysterious Sprinter Trueno, despite driving a much more powerful Mazda RX-7 (FD3S)...
